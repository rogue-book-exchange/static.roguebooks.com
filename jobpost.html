<h2>Executive Director Wanted</h2>
</center>
<p>
Rogue Book Exchange (RBE) is a non-profit organization founded to unite unwanted books with people who want them. We look like a bookstore, but there's one big difference: all the books on the shelves are free! A small percentage of donated books are sold on-line in order to pay the bills. All other books are made available free to the public.

<p>We currently have an opportunity available to expand and develop this small, firmly established non-profit enterprise in Medford, Oregon. The combined duties of Executive Director and Store Manager presently provide a modest salary with income growth potential from the expansion of book sales and development of a fund raising plan. The founder and current Executive Director will provide training in financial operation and personnel requirements, as well as continued volunteer support in site operations. 

<p>The Director will have the opportunity to set the strategic course for the programs and outreach activities undertaken by RBE. The successful candidate will have the ability to lead the Board of Directors in establishing the strategies and programs to fulfill RBE's mission, and coordinate volunteers to tackle issues of pressing need. The Director will represent the organization with the public, other non-profit groups, and the media.

<p>Skills required include:
<ul><li>Leadership ability to oversee staff</li>
<li>Creative problem solving and fund raising</li>
<li>Public relations and marketing</li>
<li>Computer skills, including learning new programs</li>
<li>Inventory maintenance and sales management</li>
<li>Customer service</li>
<li>Fiscal management and bookkeeping</li>
<li>Compliance with federal and state non-profit requirements</li>
<li>Some physical activity and lifting up to 50 pounds</li></ul>

<p>Apply with a cover letter and resume via email to: <a href="mailto:jenny@roguebooks.org">jenny@roguebooks.org</a>

<p>Or to: <br>Jenny Hamilton c/o Rogue Book Exchange
          <br>2660 Bullock Rd Ste 104
