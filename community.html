<p>The founders of Rogue Book Exchange are moving on. Without new leadership, the book exchange will close in the next two months. 

<p>If you are interested in maintaining this resource for our community, please review the following requirements for running this organization. 

<p>A community meeting will be held at Rogue Book Exchange at <b>2pm on Sunday, February 5</b>. If a new board has not been selected at the end of this meeting, we will begin dissolving the organization immediately. The founding executive director will provide training and transitional support if a new board takes over.

<p>If you would like more details prior to the meeting, please direct questions or concerns to <a href="mailto:roguebookexchange@gmail.com">roguebookexchange@gmail.com.</a>

<p>Rogue Book Exchange is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. To move forward, it is necessary to find at least 3 active board members. Minimum board meeting requirements are semi-annual. The board will be responsible for performing, or finding additional volunteers to perform, the following tasks:

<p>Banking (~3 hours/month)
<ul><li>semi-monthly paycheck and paperwork</li>
<li>monthly deposit of cash donations and rent/utility payment</li>
<li>quarterly payroll tax forms and payment</li>
<li>annual IRS and Oregon Dept of Justice filing</li>
<li>annual renewal of board liability policy and workers compensation insurance</li></ul>

<p>Store front business (minimal hours, but weekly attention is required)
<ul><li>stock office supplies, collect mail, keep files up-to-date</li>
<li>make sure store is open during open hours and staff is productive</li></ul>

<p>On-line Sales (daily tasks required, ~10 hours/week while training, would decrease with experience)
<ul><li>list books for sale and keep listings current and competitively priced</li>
<li>answer on-line customer queries, issue refunds as necessary, etc.</li></ul>

<p>In addition to these tasks which are on-going, it is clear that a successful board will need to pursue fund raising and organizational development activities.

<p>Rogue Book Exchange currently has one full time employee who generally oversees daily store front operations and ships on-line sales. We have about $4000 in the bank, but the balance is generally lowering by $100-200/month. Several grant applications have been written and would be provided to the new board to submit for foundation review.

<p>Incoming donation levels are high and show no signs of decreasing, and patron traffic is similarly strong. We continue to see first time visitors on a regular basis-- traffic could likely be increased with a concerted outreach/publicity campaign.
